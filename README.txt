Fix Edge Search to Google
=========================

What this does
--------------
- Redirects Bing/MSN search result pages to Google, keeping your search query.
- Redirects Edge/MSN start pages to google.com.
- Replaces the Edge new tab page with a redirect to google.com.

Install (sideload) in Edge
--------------------------
1. Extract this ZIP somewhere permanent (e.g. Documents\edge-google-fix).
2. In Edge, open: edge://extensions
3. Turn on "Developer mode" (top-left).
4. Click "Load unpacked".
5. Select the folder you extracted.

Optional manual tweak
---------------------
In Edge settings, you can still set Google as the default search engine:
Settings → Privacy, search, and services → Address bar and search →
"Manage search engines" → set Google as default.

Note:
Extensions are not allowed to flip that setting for you, so this
extension works by redirecting the Bing/MSN pages to Google instead.
